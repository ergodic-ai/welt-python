# Changelog

## 0.7.0

- `Client`, `AsyncClient`, `Classifier` and `Regressor` now default to
  `https://welt.ergodic.dev`. An explicit `base_url` takes precedence over
  `WELT_BASE_URL`, which takes precedence over the hosted default. Local service
  users must pass `base_url="http://localhost:8080"` or set `WELT_BASE_URL` explicitly.
- Authenticated operations reject missing workspace keys before sending a request.
  Public model and research catalogue reads remain keyless. Authentication and
  permission errors explain workspace-key setup; current keys are redacted from
  server error messages and diagnostic attributes.
- `Classifier` and `Regressor` accept `fit(df, target="column")` and
  `submit_fit(df, target="column")`. Exactly one of `y` or `target` is required;
  targets require a direct pandas DataFrame with unique, nonempty string columns.
  The declared target is removed from features and transmitted as labels using the
  existing dataset contract. Separate `fit(X, y)`, array inputs, sklearn cloning,
  Pipeline/CV, immutable predictor versions and explicit task selection remain.
- Named prediction-schema mismatches report bounded missing/extra column names.
  Errors display only bounded opaque request/job identifiers.
- `Job.result(timeout=...)` and `AsyncJob.result(timeout=...)` account for polling,
  read retries and the final result read. Zero timeout sends no read. HTTP timeout
  phases are capped at the remaining local wait budget. Async requests have a
  cancellable total-await bound; synchronous transports cannot be forcibly
  interrupted, and separate HTTP phases can exceed a strict wall-clock bound.
  Elapsed time is checked after each read. This wait starts after submission and
  does not bound uploads or submission. Timeout preserves the durable job and
  supplies reconnect guidance using the same origin and current credentials.

No new large-file, resumable-upload or Parquet batch API is included in this release.
Existing in-memory CSV/Parquet estimator input behavior is retained.
